Situatedness - Cop

Situatedness is the key attribute of communities of practice. Members share a common practice using a number of social relations and interactions.
These interactions lead them to help each other foster, maintain, and improve their situated practice. 

Informalality - IN

In this type of communities members freely communicate through informal interactions (collocated or otherwise). They
can exchange knowledge and artifacts without any protocol or restriction across any kind of distance.

Formality - FN

An official, formal member status is the key attribute of formal networks. Candidate members are carefully
evaluated before receiving membership. This process ensures members compatibility with the network’s goals.

Engagement - IC or NoP

The need for active member engagement is the key attribute of informal communities. Members actively engage in a mission or goal for personal and societal benefit.
These communities don’t have organizational sponsors pushing for their
success; their success depends exclusively on their members’ active engagement in the community mission.
